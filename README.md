KryoNetty is a Java library that provides clean and simple API for efficient TCP and UDP client/server network communication using [Netty](http://netty.io/). KryoNetty uses the [Kryo serialization library](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryo) to automatically and efficiently transfer object graphs across the network.

KryoNetty is very similar to [KryoNet](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/kryonet), which does the exact same thing but using its own NIO-based networking. KryoNet has more features than KryoNetty, which in its current state mostly serves as a simple example of how Kryo can be used with Netty.
